								<figcaption>In 2001, Lidia Bastianich, Joe Bastianich and Mario Batali joined forces to create La Mozza, a 100 acre property located in the Maremma region of Tuscany (Magliano in Toscana, Grosseto) near Scansano southwest of Montalcino, 10 miles from the Tyrrhenian sea. Unlike other regions of Tuscany which are bound to regulations which define and restrict grapes and wine styles, Maremma allows more freedom of expression in order to achieve our goal of producing unique wines by incorporating mediterranean varietals such as Alicante, Petit Verdot, and Syrah. Through the research of our winemaker Maurizio Castelli, who also produces the Bastianich wines in Friuli, we are convinced that La Mozza is the ideal location. info by <a href="http://www.garyswine.com/fine_wine/italy/06398.html">Lidia Bastianich, Joe Bastianich and Mario Batali</a> image supplied from <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Burgundy_bottles.jpg">click here</a></figcaption>

							<figure>
								<a href="images/paperlarge.jpg"><img src="images/paper.jpg" alt="Italian Sparkling"/></a>
								<figcaption>Rosecco is a white wine grape variety used to make sparkling wine. It also happens to be a region located in Veneto in northwest Italy. Many call the Prosecco grape “Glera.” Most Prosecco wines are meant to be enjoyed young and fresh, so try to buy the newest vintage. You’ll find the aromatics to be flowery and peachy with nuances of vanilla bean, even though it will taste dry (aka not sweet). Still, Proseccos do taste slightly sweeter than traditional Champagne. If you see Prosecco rosé, know that the pink color comes from the addition of a touch of Pinot Nero (Pinot Noir); giving them yellow peach and strawberry flavors. info by <a href="http://winefolly.com/review/sparkling-italian-wine/">Graziano Merotto</a> image supplied from <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6f/Paper_strip_under_wine_bottle_foil.jpg">click here</a></figcaption>
