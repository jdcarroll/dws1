							<h3>The Wine Importer</h3>
							<div class="box">
								<p id="one">Joe Dressner is part-owner of Louis/Dressner Selections, an American wine importer specializing in small producers, mostly French wines from highly regarded names like Bernard Baudry and Didier Barrouillet. When he's not traveling the world on business, he publishes one of the least pretentious blogs on the Web. It's wise and outspoken, as in a post about the state of wine tasting today. "Wine is not a vehicle for egomania, boastfulness and self-promotion. All the great 'tasters' I have known are able to submerge their ego and understand what is in the bottle."</p>

							<h3>Vinography</h3>
							<div class="box">
								<p>Alder Yarrow is a San Francisco high-tech consultant and wine geek who runs Vinography, perhaps the Web's most popular and comprehensive wine blog. Like many bloggers, he's obsessed with what he calls his second career. "Instead of watching TV, I blog," he says. "I believe telling stories about a wine helps remove it from the realm of high status where all we know about it is the price." In addition to Yarrow's wine writing, Vinography includes his restaurant reviews. For instance, he raves about the duck and quince salad, the ravioli—and, yes, the wine list—at Quince in San Francisco. It also features links to articles in magazines, newspapers and other blogs.</p>

							<h3>Jamie Goode's Blog</h3>

								<p>Jamie Goode, a Brit, writes for several well-known English wine magazines and runs the Wine Anorak website, which offers excellent articles about wine travel, winemakers and wine tasting. He saves his more casual writing for his blog, in which he's refreshingly candid about the daily life of a wine professional. "We've had a huge rise in the number of samples landing on the doorstop chez Goode…It's not that there's anything wrong with samples; rather, the problem is that you end up focusing on a skewed population of wines—those that people are most anxious to flog."</p>

										In 2001, Lidia Bastianich, Joe Bastianich and Mario Batali joined forces to create La Mozza, a 100 acre property located in the Maremma region of Tuscany (Magliano in Toscana, Grosseto) near Scansano southwest of Montalcino, 10 miles from the Tyrrhenian sea. Unlike other regions of Tuscany which are bound to regulations which define and restrict grapes and wine styles, Maremma allows more freedom of expression in order to achieve our goal of producing unique wines by incorporating mediterranean varietals such as Alicante, Petit Verdot, and Syrah. Through the research of our winemaker Maurizio Castelli, who also produces the Bastianich wines in Friuli, we are convinced that La Mozza is the ideal location. info by <a href="http://www.garyswine.com/fine_wine/italy/06398.html">Lidia Bastianich, Joe Bastianich and Mario Batali</a> image supplied from <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Burgundy_bottles.jpg">click here</a>

										Rosecco is a white wine grape variety used to make sparkling wine. It also happens to be a region located in Veneto in northwest Italy. Many call the Prosecco grape “Glera.” Most Prosecco wines are meant to be enjoyed young and fresh, so try to buy the newest vintage. You’ll find the aromatics to be flowery and peachy with nuances of vanilla bean, even though it will taste dry (aka not sweet). Still, Proseccos do taste slightly sweeter than traditional Champagne. If you see Prosecco rosé, know that the pink color comes from the addition of a touch of Pinot Nero (Pinot Noir); giving them yellow peach and strawberry flavors. info by <a href="http://winefolly.com/review/sparkling-italian-wine/">Graziano Merotto</a> image supplied from <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6f/Paper_strip_under_wine_bottle_foil.jpg">click here</a>
